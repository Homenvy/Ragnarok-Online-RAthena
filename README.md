# Ragnarok-Online-RAthena
RO private server

This will be a private server that I host for Ragnarok Online. I will post the client to here as well as the server files. When everything is up and running I will update this so anyone who stumbles upon this and wants to join may. The server rates will be determined, but atm are low rates. 

Step 1: Get the needefiles.zip file and extract them to the place you want to have RO

Step 2: Run the .exe, it should download / install all that you need filewise to run the game

Step 3: When it is done grabbing all the required files, drop the clientinfo.xml file into the data folder where you have your .exe

Step 4: Start it up, put M_ for male or F_ for female character and then the name you want on the account. Password for what password you want

Step 5: This will make your account new, you will not need M_ or F_ the next time you login. 

Step 6: You should be able to connect to the server. Enjoy!

Current rates are 2x/2x/2x. These are up for debate once more players end up on the server. There is a discord if you wish to join.
