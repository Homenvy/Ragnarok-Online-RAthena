# Ragnarok-Online-RAthena
RO private server

This will be a private server that I host for Ragnarok Online. I will post the client to here as well as the server files. When everything is up and running I will update this so anyone who stumbles upon this and wants to join may. The server rates will be determined, but atm are low rates. 

Step 1: https://github.com/llchrisll/ROenglishRE - Grab the most recent data folder here (Should be the Renewal ver)

Step 2: Get the needefiles.zip file and extract the .exe file into the client folder.

Step 3: drop the clientinfo.xml file into the data folder that is in the same directory as the .exe

Step 4: Start the .exe, put M_ for male or F_ for female character and then the name you want on the account. Password will be your discretion.

Step 5: This will make your account new, you will not need M_ or F_ the next time you login. 

Step 6: You should be able to connect to the server. Enjoy!

Current rates are 2x/2x/2x. These are up for debate once more players end up on the server. There is a discord if you wish to join.
